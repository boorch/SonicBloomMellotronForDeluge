# Sonic Bloom Mellotron Multisample Instruments For Deluge
- Created from [Sonic Bloom](https://sonicbloom.gumroad.com) Mellotron Samples Vol 1, 2 and 3.
- Long file/folder names so may not be super 7-segment display friendly. Feel free to fork and rename to fit better into 7 segment display.
- Default "Level" is 20, which gives some headroom so you can play 4 or 5 notes simultaneously without clipping.
 
## How to Install
Copy the **contents** of the "SYNTHS" folder to the SYNTHS folder of the Deluge.

Copy the folder "Sonic Bloom Mellotron" inside the SAMPLES/Multisamples folder of the Deluge. 
The path should be [SDCARD]/SAMPLES/Multisamples/Sonic Bloom Mellotron
